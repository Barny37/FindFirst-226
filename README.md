# About FindFirst
This application sets out to simplify and enrich individuals and teams
knowledge resources such as bookmarks, PDFs, notes, etc. Allowing them to be 
searched not only by keyword but semantic meaning. 

Create organization to the copious amount of knowledge available, for students,
devs, teachers, and the common person.

## Features 

### Easy Searching
For example when the user arrives to the page they will have a search bar that is right at the top ready for user to immediately begin doing
full context page searches. 

### Quick Reference
This section shows the bookmarks that are frequently referenced. 

### Team Knowledgebase
In this section the bookmarks become the welcome page for new member to share team knowledge that is relevant to the team.

### RSS Feed from bookmarked sites
Many of the sites a user bookmarks they may also want an RSS feed from, this solves two problems at once.

### Reading list
A hit list of read laters.
